<p><strong>Evidence of intent to settle and find employment in B.C.: Applicants to the International Post-Graduate or the EEBC International Post-Graduate streams must provide evidence of ability and intent to live and work in B.C.</strong></p>

<p>Evidence of this may include:</p>

<p><em>• the length of any previous and/or current period of residence in B.C.;</em></p>

<p><em>• current employment in B.C.;</em></p>

<p><em>• employment search details (prospective employers, applications, networking efforts, business development, etc.);</em></p>

<p><em>• community involvement;</em></p>

<p><em>• ability to financially support yourself and your dependants (if any) in B.C.; and</em></p>

<p><em>• your plan to obtain or maintain legal authorization to work in B.C.</em></p>
