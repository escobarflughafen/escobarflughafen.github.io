<p>My last semester comes to an end and not many things happened within this one or two weeks.</p>

<p>I got full marks in all three assignments of machine learning course and not to much to worry about in the finals. I will review SVM tonight and do the 22fall final tomorrow.</p>

<p>New discovery - I’ve never been to the 7th floor of the library, and there is a research common room for grad students – with punch code lock. Dual monitors, iMacs and spacious desks there. Very quiet and I consider there is a good place for me to do job searches after my finals. (Thanks a friend of me, he discovered this place. And I found that place in the last few weeks of my master’s, LOL).</p>

<p>Another thing to remind myself is that I need to use my dental benefit and eyeglasses benefit within this month, since I’ve never used them.</p>

<p>I bought a ThinkPad P52s, for only $375 (after tax), and it looks good, with 4K display. However its performance is quite unpleasant when running Windows 11. Especially it takes a lot of time to boot a Ubuntu VM using VirtualBox, looking for solution for that.</p>

<p>Do delivery for 3-4 days after this Wednesday before the final grades coming out.  Keep eyes out of phone while driving and make sure safety.</p>

<p>Take the AZ-101 test and prepare for interviews. Since no TA works for me after graduated, a job offer is all I need.</p>

<p>Songs I’ve been looping this two weeks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Giant - Gentle Giant</li>
  <li>Bonito Generation - Kero Kero Bonito</li>
  <li>Azure d’Or</li>
  <li>Someday - Teddy Robin</li>
</ul>
